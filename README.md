# **Code Snippet**
Here I utulized the hero class built in with Bulma to take up a specific section of my webpage and also included a navbar with links to my personal linkedin and github.

```js
section class="hero is-fullheight is-black" id="content1">

        <!-- Hero head: will stick at the top -->
        <div class="hero-head">

            <nav class="navbar" role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation" id="navbar1">
                <div class="navbar-brand">
                    <h1 class="mt-3 has-text-white ml-5">Connect with me!</h1>


                    <a role="button" class="navbar-burger" aria-label="menu" aria-expanded="true"
                        data-target="navbarBasicExample">
                        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
                        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
                        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    </a>
                </div>

                <div id="navbarBasicExample" class="navbar-menu">
                    <div class="navbar-end">
                        <a class="navbar-item has-text-white" href="https://github.com/ArjayCaluag">
                            Github
                        </a>

                        <a class="navbar-item has-text-white"
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-arjay-caluag-00b29b182/">
                            Linkedin
                        </a>
                        <!-- <a class="navbar-item has-text-white" href="assets/Ron-ArjayCaluagBerResume.pdf">

                    </div>
